# Places geodatabase web admin tool
This is a simple web-based tool for administering a central database of named places and their locations and/or administrative boundaries. This database will coordinate references to named places accross foundation projects and datasets.

Place locations and boundaries are derived from OpenStreetMap using Nominatim.
